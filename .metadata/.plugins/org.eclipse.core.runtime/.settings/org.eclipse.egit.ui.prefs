commit_dialog_history_messages=<?xml version\="1.0" encoding\="UTF-8"?>\n<messages>\n<message>Added database, as well query statements to input dictionary into&\#x0A;database. Also added mySql connector files.</message>\n<message>Finished updating LeftRight and NearFar neural network classes.</message>\n<message>Continued work on the NeuralNetwork classes. They should be ready to use&\#x0A;in terms of basic functionality. Work still needs to be done if we want&\#x0A;to utilize Neuroph&apos;s save/load functionality.</message>\n<message>Not sure what is getting committed.</message>\n<message>Imported and compiled Neuroph into project. Added a skeleton class for&\#x0A;SpecialCase and some basic classes for training our&\#x0A;LeftRightNeuralNetwork and NearFarNeuralNetwork.</message>\n<message>Not sure what&apos;s changed.</message>\n<message>Moved keyboard side determination from Letter to KeyPosition for greater&\#x0A;access by other classes. Added a distance setter to Bigram to set the&\#x0A;NEAR/FAR relationship and updated code in Bigram so it sets the&\#x0A;LEFT/RIGHT relationship for the two characters.</message>\n<message>Added Letter, LetterPair, DISTANCE, and KEYBOARD_SIDE classes. None of&\#x0A;these are linked to any of the original classes though.</message>\n<message>Added TextRetrieval class. Can get (some form of) output now.</message>\n<message>Updated KMeans with new code to allow us to read in training data. This&\#x0A;code is commented out at the moment in the constructor for KMeans</message>\n</messages>
