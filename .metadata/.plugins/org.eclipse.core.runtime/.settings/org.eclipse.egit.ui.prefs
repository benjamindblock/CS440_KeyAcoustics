commit_dialog_history_messages=<?xml version\="1.0" encoding\="UTF-8"?>\n<messages>\n<message>Didn&apos;t do anything, really.</message>\n<message>Added Neuroph correctly. Updated TextStream to read the dictionary&\#x0A;correctly. Added getter methods to Word and Bigram. Maybe made a few&\#x0A;minors changes to the neural network classes.</message>\n<message>Finished updating LeftRight and NearFar neural network classes.</message>\n<message>Continued work on the NeuralNetwork classes. They should be ready to use&\#x0A;in terms of basic functionality. Work still needs to be done if we want&\#x0A;to utilize Neuroph&apos;s save/load functionality.</message>\n<message>Not sure what is getting committed.</message>\n<message>Imported and compiled Neuroph into project. Added a skeleton class for&\#x0A;SpecialCase and some basic classes for training our&\#x0A;LeftRightNeuralNetwork and NearFarNeuralNetwork.</message>\n<message>Not sure what&apos;s changed.</message>\n<message>Moved keyboard side determination from Letter to KeyPosition for greater&\#x0A;access by other classes. Added a distance setter to Bigram to set the&\#x0A;NEAR/FAR relationship and updated code in Bigram so it sets the&\#x0A;LEFT/RIGHT relationship for the two characters.</message>\n<message>Added Letter, LetterPair, DISTANCE, and KEYBOARD_SIDE classes. None of&\#x0A;these are linked to any of the original classes though.</message>\n<message>Added TextRetrieval class. Can get (some form of) output now.</message>\n</messages>
